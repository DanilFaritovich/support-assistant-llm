description: Continuous Delivery conventions for Docker Compose projects using GitHub Actions, GHCR, immutable images, GitHub Environments, server runtime configuration, migrations, health checks, and rollback. Route to the foundation phase when preparing a project before a server exists, and to production integration when VDS/GitHub production prerequisites are ready.

# Continuous Delivery Standard

Use this standard for Dockerized applications when Docker Compose is sufficient.

Do not introduce Kubernetes only to implement CD.

## Core deployment model

Preferred production flow:

```text
Pull Request
  -> CI
  -> merge to stable production source
  -> build production images
  -> push immutable images to registry
  -> deploy exact image versions
  -> migrations
  -> update services
  -> health checks
  -> success
```

Production deployment should normally start only from `main`, a release/tag, or another explicitly approved stable source.

Do not deploy arbitrary feature branches to production.

## Build once, deploy the same artifact

Build application images in GitHub Actions and publish them to the configured registry, normally GHCR for GitHub-hosted portfolio projects.

Do not SSH to the server and rebuild application source there.

Preferred:

```text
GitHub Actions
  -> docker build
  -> GHCR
  -> VDS pulls exact image
```

Production must run the same artifact produced by the deployment workflow.

## Immutable production state

Every deployment must identify the exact application image.

Prefer immutable digests:

```text
ghcr.io/<owner>/<image>@sha256:<digest>
```

A commit-SHA tag may also be published for readability.

Do not rely only on mutable tags such as `latest` for production state or rollback.

The deployed Git revision and image digests must be discoverable.

## Repository vs runtime state

Version-control safe deployment artifacts such as:

- `compose.production.yml`;
- Dockerfiles;
- reverse-proxy configuration;
- deployment scripts;
- Makefile targets;
- GitHub Actions workflows;
- migrations;
- `.env.example`;
- deployment documentation.

Never commit:

- production `.env`;
- passwords/API keys/tokens;
- private SSH keys;
- private certificates;
- database credentials.

Server-side runtime configuration is deployment state, not repository state.

## Production topology

Expose only the public gateway when practical.

Typical topology:

```text
Internet
  |
  v
Nginx / Caddy
  |
  +--> frontend
  |
  +--> /api/ -> backend
                  |
                  +--> PostgreSQL / SQLite volume
                  +--> Redis
```

Backend, databases, and Redis should normally remain internal and must not publish production host ports without a concrete need.

Preserve the project's chosen reverse proxy. Do not replace Nginx with Caddy or vice versa merely because an example differs.

## Phase routing

Continuous Delivery is implemented in two phases so project preparation does not depend on production credentials or a live server.

### Phase 1: foundation

Use [references/foundation.md](./references/foundation.md) when the task is to:

- prepare a project for CD;
- add production Compose/build/publish artifacts;
- define deployment scripts/Makefile commands;
- define the VDS/GitHub Environment contract;
- validate deployment artifacts without a live production server.

This phase must not require real production secrets, SSH access, or an existing VDS.

### Phase 2: production integration

Use [references/production-integration.md](./references/production-integration.md) when:

- the VDS exists;
- required GitHub Environment secrets/variables can be configured;
- SSH and runtime deployment prerequisites are ready;
- the task is to complete, exercise, or harden end-to-end production deployment.

Do not redesign a valid foundation during integration unless a concrete incompatibility is found.

## Context loading

Load only the reference for the active phase.

Do not read both phase references merely because the project eventually needs both.

If a user asks for end-to-end CD but production prerequisites do not yet exist:

1. complete the foundation phase;
2. document the exact external prerequisites;
3. stop before pretending that production integration was verified.

If a task genuinely crosses both phases and the required external prerequisites already exist, load both references in order: foundation assumptions first, then production integration.

## Common safety rules

- use least-privilege GitHub Actions permissions;
- keep production secrets scoped to a GitHub Environment;
- never expose production secrets to untrusted Pull Request jobs;
- allow only one production deployment at a time;
- keep migrations explicit;
- use bounded readiness/health waits;
- do not report success before required health verification passes;
- do not assume application image rollback reverses database/persistent state;
- prefer a dedicated non-root deployment user over root SSH;
- keep deployment logic maintainable and version-controlled.

## CI/CD boundary

Pull Request CI validates deployment artifacts but must not perform a real production deployment.

The protected production job runs only from the approved production source and environment.

## Completion

CD is complete only after both phases are satisfied:

```text
foundation ready
  -> external VDS/GitHub prerequisites configured
  -> production integration verified
  -> controlled deployment succeeds
  -> health verification succeeds
  -> rollback/failure behavior is defined
```

Do not mark production CD complete based only on generated YAML or an unexecuted deployment path.
